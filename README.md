# Task 1 - Employee Management System (Level 2)

This project is part of my **Java Internship with Codveda Technologies**.  
It is a simple **Employee Management System** implemented in Java using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

---

## Description
The system allows the user to manage employee records with basic **CRUD operations**:
- **Create** → Add a new employee  
- **Read** → View all employees or search by ID  
- **Update** → Modify employee details (name, department, salary)  
- **Delete** → Remove an employee from the system  

All records are stored in an in-memory collection (`ArrayList`), so no database is required.
