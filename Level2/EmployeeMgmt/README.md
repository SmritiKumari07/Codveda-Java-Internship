# Task 1 - Employee Management System (Level 2)

This project is part of my **Java Internship with Codveda Technologies**.  
It is a simple **Employee Management System** implemented in Java using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

---

##  Description
The system allows the user to manage employee records with basic **CRUD operations**:
- **Create** → Add a new employee  
- **Read** → View all employees or search by ID  
- **Update** → Modify employee details (name, department, salary)  
- **Delete** → Remove an employee from the system  

All records are stored in an in-memory collection (`ArrayList`), so no database is required.

---

##  Skills Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java  
- Encapsulation and class design (`Employee` class)  
- CRUD operations using `ArrayList`  
- Input validation and exception handling  
- Console-based menu-driven application  

---

##  Files Included
- `Employee.java` → Represents an employee object with fields and methods.  
- `EmployeeManagementSystem.java` → Main program with menu and CRUD functionality.  
- `README.md` (this file)

---

## How to Run
1. Compile both files:
   ```bash
   javac Employee.java EmployeeManagementSystem.java
