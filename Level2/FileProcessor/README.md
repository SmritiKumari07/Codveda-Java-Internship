# Task 2 - File Processor (Level 2)

This project is part of my **Java Internship with Codveda Technologies**.  
It is a simple Java program that demonstrates **file handling** operations — reading from a file, processing its contents, and writing the results to another file.

---

## Description
- Reads a text file provided by the user.  
- Processes the content to calculate:
  - **Number of lines**  
  - **Number of words**  
  - **Number of characters**  
- Writes the processed results to an **output file**.  
- Handles exceptions such as missing files or invalid paths gracefully.  

---

##  Skills Covered
- File handling in Java (`FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`, `Files`)  
- Exception handling (`IOException`, `FileNotFoundException`)  
- String processing and word counting  
- User input handling with `Scanner`  

---

##  Files Included
- `FileProcessor.java` → Source code for file handling  
- `README.md` (this file)

---

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac FileProcessor.java
