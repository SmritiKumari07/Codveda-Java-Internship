# Task 2 - Simple Number Guessing Game (Level 1)

This project is part of my **Java Internship with Codveda Technologies**.  
It is a console-based **Number Guessing Game** implemented in Java.

---

## Description
- The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**.  
- The player has **7 attempts** to guess the number.  
- After each guess, the program gives feedback:
  - `"Too high"` → if the guess is greater than the number.  
  - `"Too low"` → if the guess is smaller than the number.  
  - `"Correct!"` → if the guess matches the number.  
- Handles **invalid inputs** and ensures only valid integers within the range are accepted.  

---

##  Skills Covered
- Random number generation using `Random` class  
- Loops and conditionals in Java  
- User input handling with `Scanner`  
- Exception handling for invalid inputs
