# Task 1 - Binary Search Tree (Level 3)

This project is part of my **Java Internship with Codveda Technologies**.  
It is a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** implementation in Java with basic operations and tree traversals.

---

##  Description
- A **Binary Search Tree** is a hierarchical data structure where:
  - Left child < Parent node < Right child.  
- This program allows users to interact with a BST via a **console menu**.  

### Supported Operations:
- **Insert** → Add a new value into the BST  
- **Search** → Check if a value exists in the BST  
- **Delete** → Remove a node (handles leaf, single child, and two children cases)  
- **Inorder Traversal** → Left → Root → Right  
- **Preorder Traversal** → Root → Left → Right  
- **Postorder Traversal** → Left → Right → Root

##  Skills Covered
- Data Structures in Java  
- Recursion for traversals and tree operations  
- Menu-driven console applications  
- User input handling with `Scanner`  

---

##  Files Included
- `BinarySearchTree.java` → Source code for BST implementation  
- `README.md` (this file)

##  How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac BinarySearchTree.java
